# PETMR-4CMRAC-Correction-maps
The code for the *Pelvic PET/MR attenuation correction in the image space using generative adversarial networks* will be presented here. 

The code is based on the excellent pytorch [pix2pix implementation](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) which again was inspired by [DCGAN](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/dcgan).
